1 go to hosted root URL
    you should see a welcome message in a frame on the left, and a table of snippets on the right
2 Reduce the width of the window below 1200 px
    you should see the frame with the welcome message move on top of the table of snippets
    The welcome message frame should take up about 66% of the width of the grey box bounding the page content, centered in this box
3 Reduce the width of the window below 768 px
    The welcome message frame should take up the whole width of the grey bounding box (save for a little padding on either side of the frame)
4 Click on the CREATOR label at the top of the column
    the rows should be reordered by the alphabetical order of the creator
    Click on the CREATOR label again
        the order of the rows should be reversed
    repeat step 4 for each column's label.  The order should be alphabetical by that column, and clicking again should reverse that order
5 Type into the form field labeled Search:
    The rows should be filtered out if none of the cells in the row contain the search string
6 Click on the creator name of the first row on the table.
    The whole row should be highlighted
    The welcome message should be replaced in its frame by a Hello world application in Java
    Repeat for the creator cell in each row. The rows to which each cell belongs should become highlighted and the code frame should show the following snippets:
        a CREATE TABLE sql function call
        a html div tag with id="custom"
        the php script for establishing a database connection
    Repeat step 6 for each cell the description column and language column.  Clicking on each cell should highlight its row and show its snippet in the frame.
